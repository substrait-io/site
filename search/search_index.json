Instead, it is helpful to construct some other expression constructs. These constructs should be focused on different expression types as opposed to something that directly related to syntantic sugar. For example, CAST and EXTRACT or SQL operations that are presented using specialized syntax. However, they can easily modeled using a function paradigm with minimal complexity. Literal Expressions \u00b6 For each data type, it is possible to create a literal value for that data type. The representation depends on the serialization format. If Expression \u00b6 An if value expression is an expression composed of one if clause, zero or more else if clauses and an else clause. In pseudo code, they are envisioned as: if <boolean expression> then <result expression 1> else if <boolean expression> then <result expression 2> (zero or more times) else <result expression 3> When an if expression is declared, all return expressions must be the same identical type. Shortcut Behavior \u00b6 An if expression is expected to logically short-cicuit on a postive outcome. This means that a skipped else/elseif expression cannot cause an error.

The plan is composed of one or more relational operations. Relational operations are well-defined transformation operations that work by taking zero or more input datasets and transforming them into zero or more output transformations. Substrait defines a core set of transformations and users are also able to extend the operations with their own specialized operations. Each relational operation is composed of several different properties. Common properties for relational operations include the following: Property Description Type Emit The set of columns output from this operation and the order of those columns. Logical & Physical Hints A set of optionally provided, optionally consumed information about an operation that better inform execution. These might include estimated number of input and output records, estimated record size, likely filter reduction, estimated dictionary size, etc. These can also include implementation specific pieces of execution information. Physical Constraint A set of runtime constraints around the operation, limiting its consumption based on irl resources (CPU, memory) as well as virtual resources like number of records produced, largest record size, etc. Physical Relational Signatures \u00b6 In functions, function signatures are declared externally to the use of those signatures (function bindings). In the case of relational operations, signatures are declared directly in the specification. This is due to the speed of change and number of total operations. Relational operations in the specification are expected to be <100 for several years with additions being infrequent. On the other hand, there is an expectation of both a much larger number of functions (1,000s) and a much higher velocity of additions. Each Relational Operation must declare the following: Transformation logic around properties of the data. For example, does a relational operation maintain sortedness of a field? Does an operation change the distribution of data? How many input sets does an operation produce? Does the operator produce an output (by specification, we limit relational operations to a single output at this time) What is the schema and field ordering of an output (see emit below)? Emit: Output Ordering \u00b6 A relational operation uses field references to access specific fields of the input stream. Field references are always ordinal based on the order of the incoming streams. Each relational operation must declare the order of its output data. To simpify things, each relational operation can be in one of two modes: Direct output : The order of outputs is based on the definition declared by the relational operation. Remap : A listed ordering of the direct outputs. This remapping can be also used to drop columns no longer used (such as a filter field or join keys after a join). Note that remapping/exclusion can only be done at the outputs root struct. Filtering of compound values or extracting subsets must be done through other operation types (e.g. projection). Relation Properties \u00b6 There are number of predefined properties that exist in Substrait relations. These include: Distribution \u00b6 When data is partitioned across multiple sibling sets, distribution describes that set of properties that apply to any one partition. This is based on a set of distribution expression properties. A distribution is declared as a set of one or more fields and a distribution type across all fields. Property Description Required Distribution Fields List of fields references that describe distribution (e.g. [0,2:4,5:0:0]). The order of these references do not impact results. Required for Partitioned distribution type. Disallowed for Singleton distribution type. Distribution Type PARTITIONED: For a discrete tuple of values for the declared distribution fields, all records with that tuple are located in the same partition. SINGLETON: there will only be a single partition for this operation. Required Orderedness \u00b6 A guarantee that data output from this operation is provided with a sort order. The sort order will be declared based on a set of sort field definitions based on the emitted output of this operation. Property Description Required Sort Fields A list of fields that the data are ordered by. The list is in order of the sort. If sort by [0,1] this means we only consider the data for field 1 is only ordered within each discrete value of field 0. At least one required. Per - Sort Field A field reference that the data is sorted by. Required Per - Sort Type The order of the data. See ordering types below. Required Ordering Types \u00b6 Ordering Descriptions Nulls Position Ascending Returns data in a ascending order based on the quality function associated with the type. Nulls are included before any values. First Descending Returns data in a descending order based on the quality function associated with the type. Nulls are included before any values. First Ascending Returns data in a ascending order based on the quality function associated with the type. Nulls are included after any values. Last Descending Returns data in a descending order based on the quality function associated with the type. Nulls are included after any values. Last Custom function identifier Returns data using a custom function that returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the order of the data. Per Function Clustered Ensures that all equal values are coalesced (but no ordering betwixt values is defined). E.g, for values 1,2,3,1,2,3, output bould be any of the following 1,1,2,2,3,3 or 2,2,3,3,1,1 or 3,3,2,2,1,1 or 3,3,1,1,2,2. N/A, may appear anywhere but will be coalesced. Discussion Points \u00b6 Do we try to make read definition types more extensible ala function signatures? Is that necessary if we have a custom relational operator? How do we express decomposed types. For example, the Iceberg type above is for early logical planning. Once we do some operations, it may produce a list of Iceberg file reads.

Once established, new versions of the specification will follow a normal development/release process. To provide something to peruse while clarifying an openness to the community during the initial development of the specification, we plan to follow the following steps for development of the specification. We will use github branches to describe each of these steps and patches will be proposed to be moved from one branch to the next to allow review of documents while still having strawmen to start with. The steps are: Empty - No outline has been produced. A sketch needs to be produced for people to react and iterate on. Sketch - Something has been written but should serve more as a conceptual backing for what should be achieved in this part of the specification. No collaboration or consensus has occurred. This will be discussed and iterated on until an initial WIP version can be patched. The WIP version will be held in a PR to iterate on until it is committed to the WIP branch of the repository. WIP - An initial version that multiple contributors have agreed to has been produced for this portion of the specification. Any user is welcome to propose additional changes or discussions with regards to this component but it now represents a community intention. Commit - Believed to be a well-formed plan for this portion of the specification. Documents that have had no outstanding reviews for 14 days will be moved from WIP to commit. Changes can still be made but the section should no longer be under constant revision. (This status is more for external observers to understand the progress of the specification than something that influences internal project process.) Once all portions of the specification have been moved to commit (or eliminated), the specification will move to an initial version number. To try to get a working end-to-end model as quickly as possible, a small number of items have been prioritized. The set of components outlined here are proposed as a mechanism for having bite-size review/discussion chunks to make forward progress. Components \u00b6 Priority Status Section Description 1 sketch Simple Logical Types A way to describe the set of basic types that will be operated on within a plan. Only includes simple types such as integers and doubles (nothing configurable or compound). sketch Compound Logical Types Expression of types that go beyond simple scalar values. Key concepts here include: configurable types such as fixed length and numeric types as well as compound types such as structs, maps, lists, etc. sketch Physical Types Physical extensions to logical types. sketch User Defined Types Extensions that can be defined for specific IR producers/consumers. 2 sketch Field References Expressions to identify which portions of a record should be 3 sketch Scalar Functions Description of how functions are specified. Concepts include arguments, variadic functions, output type derivation, etc. sketch Scalar Function List A list of well-known canonical functions in yaml format. sketch Specialized Record Expressions Specialized expression types that are more naturally expressed outside the function paradigm. Examples include items such as if/then/else and switch statements. sketch Aggregate Functions Functions that are expressed in aggregation operations. Examples include things such as SUM, COUNT, etc. Operations take many records and collapse them into a single (possibly compound) value. sketch Window Functions Functions that relate a record to a set of encompassing records. Examples in SQL include RANK, NTILE, etc. empty Table Functions Functions that convert one or more values from an input record into 0..N output records. Example include operations such as explode, pos-exlode, etc. sketch User Defined Functions Reusable named functions that are built beyond the core specification. Implementations are typically registered thorugh external means (drop a file in a directory, send a special command with implementation, etc). sketch Embedded Functions Functions implementations embedded directly within the plan. Frequently used in data scicence workflows where business logic is interpersed with standard operations. 4 sketch Relation Basics Basic concepts around relational algebra, record emit and properties. sketch Logical Relations Common relational operations used in compute plans including project, join, aggregation, etc. sketch Physical Relations Specific execution sub-variations of common relational operations that describe have multiple unique physical variants associated with a single logical operation. Examples include hash join, merge join, nested loop join, etc. empty User Defined Relations Installed and reusable relational operations customized to a particular platform. empty Embedded Relations Relational operations where plans contain the \u201cmachine code\u201d to directly execute the necessary operations. 5 sketch Text Serialization A human producable & consumable representation of the plan specification. 6 sketch Binary Serialization A high performance & compact binary representation of the plan specification.","title":"Specification"},{"location":"spec/specification/#specification","text":"","title":"Specification"},{"location":"spec/specification/#process","text":"The goal of this project is initially to establish a well-defined specification.

We will use github branches to describe each of these steps and patches will be proposed to be moved from one branch to the next to allow review of documents while still having strawmen to start with.
